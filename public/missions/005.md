# Mission // #005Destroy the SSC Printers on Norban

The UIB has identified SSC's printing plant. They are using the strong iron content of Norban's seas to feed these printers. The printers feed the NGF with modern munitions to combat the Sorkov League. Destroying these printers will remove a significant edge from NGF in the war.

# Goals
- Rendezvous in the sea near the printers
- Destroy as many printers as possible
- Exit the battlefield before SSC/NGF reinforcements arrive.

# Stakes
- Failing to destroy the printers would keep NGF in a technological lead against the Sorkov League.
- The printers are floating plants in Norban's Sea. Solid ground to fight on is limited.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
