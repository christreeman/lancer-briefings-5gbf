# Mission // #001
## Establish FOB-Saber
# Goals
- Enter Gaiar's Atmosphere
- Make way to target for FOB-Saber in Nov Elysia. 
- The prime goal is to recover Administrator BannerJee and Captain Markovic. We do not have the authority to engage in combat with NGF forces. Only fire if fired upon.

# Stakes
- The Safety of the VIPs is critical. Not acting will result in Union forces losing them to NGF hands.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
