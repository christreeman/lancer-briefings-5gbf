## Stop Fugitives from Escaping U.N. NEMI with GalSim AI

Four members of Squad 5GBF have gone rogue, and they are attempting to flee the U.N. Nemi with the GalSim AI. Prevent them from escaping by any means necessary. 

# Goals
- Recover the GalSim AI by any means necessary. 
- Apprehend the fugitives. Lethal force is permitted. 
- We have reason to believe the deserters in Squad 5GBF have internal support. We must stop these traitors from interfering.

# Stakes
- The contents of that AI could determine the future of Union's Third Committee. There are no more second chances here.
- The four former **5GBF** squad members are UIB's top dogs. We cannot afford to hesitate.

# Reserves
- Union reinforcements are ready to provide support to the hangar if someone can override the freight elevator's controls.
