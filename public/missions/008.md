# U.N. Nemi // 5016u
## Locate the Escaped Fugitives and Missing AI

The former members of **Squad 5GBF** are wanted dead or alive by **UIB**. **You** have been tasked with locating them. Their previous mission logs have been provided.

# Goals
- Locate Former UIB operatives, **Condor** and **Shiro**
- Locate Former UN engineer **Max**
- Locate Former UIB operative **Mozin**
- Locate Former UIB operative **Roro**
- Locate Former UIB operative **Sleepwalker**
- Locate the missing GalSim AI 

# Stakes
- These former operatives have escaped Union surveillance in the Long Rim. They could be anywhere. They are highly skilled. Take every precaution in your search.
- They were the last known people to control the **U.S.S. Enna GalSim AI**. They likely have means for paracausal reconnaissance. Tracking them will not be easy.

# Reserves
- **UN Cpt. Zoran Markovic's** ship, the **UN Thanatos**, has been stationed briefly on the outskirts of **The Long Rim**. The captain has advanced knowledge of the targets and has been ordered to provide support to your mission.
- **You** are going into space without Union support. Weapons, food, and money will need to be procured on-site. This mission could take years, so make every preparation count.
