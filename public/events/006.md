# U.N. Nemi // 5014u

Prior to starting the mission, the team prepares for the confrontation with Torren Eleppo. **Condor** baits the trap, and sends Torren a coded letter. The hope is the letter pulls Torren alone to the ambush, but the squad won't know until the final confrontation.

Squad **5GBF** kits out their frames with space capable systems, and they begin flying toward Wailan, one of the two moons of Gaiar.
