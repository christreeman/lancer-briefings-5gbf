# Granduer // 5014u

5GBF departs from their smaller recon ship with a dedicated frame re-entry vehicle. Upon landing, they encounter a huge field a space junk that has accumulated in the eye of the storm. In the center of this junk pile is an abandoned spacecraft. This desolate ship is larger than the U.N. Nemi, or just about any ship the squad has seen before. 

Once the re-entry vehicle has landed, their sensors spot movement near the abandoned ship. Strange frames pull themselves out of the junk piles and start firing on the squad. The party rushes to escape behind them into the ship. The mission is on a tight schedule, and they can't afford to lose too much time or resources to a fight here.

During the fight, Sleepwalker slices one of the strange frames in two, and discovers that none of these machines have pilots.
