5GBF departs from their smaller recon ship with a dedicated frame re-entry vehicle. Upon landing, they encounter a huge field a space junk that has accumulated in the eye of the storm. In the center of this junk pile is an abandoned spacecraft. This desolate ship is larger than the U.N. Nemi, or just about any ship the squad has seen before. 

Once the re-entry vehicle has landed, their sensors spot movement near the abandoned ship. Strange frames pull themselves out of the junk piles and start firing on the squad. The party rushes to escape behind them into the ship. The mission is on a tight schedule, and they can't afford to lose too much time or resources to a fight here.

During the fight, Sleepwalker slices one of the strange frames in two, and discovers that none of these machines have pilots. The team succesfully defeats the unmanned frames and makes it inside the vessel closing the door behind them.

After searching the ship, team 5GBF discovers this relic ship was once the USS Enna: an odyssey class vessel from thousands of years ago. They also learn that the strange signal that brought them here periodically whispers out from deeper down a narrow hallway. Following this signal, they notice another team in a seperate hallway heading the same way. Sleepwalkers attempts to trail them and sneak closer for more information, but they were spotted. Both parties begin running down the hallway. 

They soon spot three terminals emanating the source of the strange signal. Necromancer trys communicating to deescalate the situation. They learn this other team is a Horus Cell, and they were brought by the same signal. The Horus cell needs the data on these terminals, and would be willing to stay peaceful if both parties drop their weapons, and swap hostages. The 5GBF squad offers Mozin, and the Horus cell offers their cataphract. Necromancer starts a download of the data on one of the terminals, but fails to get a full copy. The Horus cell manages to get a complete copy. The Horus cell betrays the peace at the last second, and begin making their way to destroy the last terminal to stop team 5gbf from getting a full copy. Combat Ensues!
